The obstacles in sight should never have the right
To be part of the problem
But even if we tried, we'd hardly have the time
To spend in living our lives right
Don't say that I could change, 'cause even if you stayed
We'd still be climbing up this mountain
So let us go our ways and skip out all the pain
And forget all the...
Bricks we've laid into this path, yet the house remains undone
Flooding at every cloud and withering in the sun
How's one meant to grow when walls keep caving in?
The ceiling above us has denied its existence in...
Bridges built for better days, but they won't hold our weight
The ropes have been wearing thin, entangling in the wind
How's one meant to grow when walls keep caving in?
The ceiling above us has denied its existence in...
Oh, of all the times we tried, I've still been up all night
Writing songs of you
And even though you're gone, they will still live on
In a memory or two
Of all the streets I see, no one will ever be
Comparable to you
So with these words I go, I just wanted you to know
That my dreams are still of you
