I leap out of the same routine I'm living day by
day
To that astounding stage with all adventures
waiting
My eyes are set on this globe, we can see it
rotate
And then "hello," we'll say
A special day is a heartbeat away
Greenery, shining view
As a brand-new season has begun
There was me, staring at that blue light tone
And I don't even know all their faces
Not yet friends, but classmates only
It's nothing near what life should be
Contrast with that
Ideal I had imagined in my mind as
Days unfold and pass me by
But now, at last, we're meeting up
Reality and visions merging
So, my heart is pounding and
I cannot hold it back
We promised to meet and hang out
In that place I've been dreaming 'bout
A day we won't forget is now about to start
Opening with a spark
Matching dreams I had, visions and this day
convene
Now I step outside the pace of my routine
And, if I take a picture, a piece of this scene
Ah, come what may
So many smiles on the faces I see
"Let's get on that," someone said, and we hopped
on a coaster
The matching headbands we have put on
Priceless moments spill out, overflow, and still
accrue
Even the waiting time, you know, is so dear to
me too
Where should I be heading up to now?
I'm walking like I'm on a cloud
Oh, it's almost uncanny
As I'm noticing how quickly time is passing by
And the sun, on its way down
Unveiled a city view
Lights are shining on so bright, a parade of
hues
I'll remember, forever
My soul is enthused
I'm so very glad I could come here
My heart's deeply moved
Matching dreams I had, visions and this day
convene
I burst out of my everyday same routine
And if I take a picture, nothing will appear
Those memories are forevermore waiting here
Every season to come, they revolve on and on
In this very place, the smiles we've
encountered, all
Flutter down and accumulate inside my heart
So, when can I see you again the next time
around?
Step out of my regular day-to-day
To that eternal stage with all adventures
waiting
My eyes are set on this globe, we can see it
rotate
And then "hello," we'll say
A special day is a heartbeat away
